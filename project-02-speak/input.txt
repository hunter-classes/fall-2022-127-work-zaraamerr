Today, I'm sailing out to the ocean on my ship. I'm with my friends and we are looking for gold coins. All the people on this ship are excited to become wealthy. What they don't know is that the only people on this ship that are getting rich are myself, my wife, and my kids. I fooled these men into using the best machinery on board to find all the coins in these oceans. These guys don't know what's coming, I have cheated them of their fortunes. X1 shouted one of the guys. I knew that they had found treasure. We lifted the treasure into the ship and we celebrated with dinner in the cafeteria. Everyone was having a good time and was completely drunk. I took this chance to sneak the gold out of the basement and rushed my kids and wife into a lifeboat. Before these dumb guys woke up, I had been long gone.X2 yelled all the guys angrily. They had been robbed and taken by surprise. X3,some pirates they turned out to be.
