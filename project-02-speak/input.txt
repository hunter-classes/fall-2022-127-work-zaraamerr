Today, I'm sailing out to the ocean on my ship. I'm with my friends and we are looking for gold coins. All the people on this ship are excited to become wealthy. What they don't know is that the only people on this ship that are getting rich are myself, my wife, and my children. I fooled these guys into using the best machinery on board to find all the coins in this sea. These fools don't know what's coming, I have cheated them of their fortunes. Hey! shouted one of the men. I knew that they had found the treasure. The guys lifted the treasure into the ship and we celebrated with dinner in the cafeteria. Everyone was having a good time and was completely drunk. I took this chance to sneak the treasure out of the basement and rushed my kids and wife over into a lifeboat. Before these dumb guys woke up, I had been long gone. Damn you! yelled all the guys angrily. They had been cheated and taken by surprise. Some pirates they turned out to be.
