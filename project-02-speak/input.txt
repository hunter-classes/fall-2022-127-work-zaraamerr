Hi, buddy! My name is Pete Blackbeard and I'm traveling out to the ocean with my friends. Yeah, these guys are looking for treasure. We don't know where it could be, but you bet Shiverin' Shelly could find it. She is an expert of the sea. Once we find it, we'll celebrate with dinner and drinks in the cafeteria until we are drunk.
